welcome! the title of our project is **travelbois** and in short, it allows users to search cities (either based on name or zipcode) and view the current/past/future climate and weather. the app will also provide historical data on the country in question, from the geography to the current political situation. This is intended to help travelers can make the most informed decisions about where they want to go.

Dependencies:
1. We are using **Python3**
2. a virtual environment (aka venv)
3. flask
   - launch the venv using ". path/<venv name>/bin/activate"
   - pip install flask

Instructions for launch:
   1. start up your venv by typing the command . path/<venv name>/bin/activate
   2. cd to the project repository
   3. type in python app.py
   4. go to the localhost:5000 address on your chosen browser
